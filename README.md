# Determining Correlation Between Parking and Quality of Life (Code)

The following repository holds portions of code used for a report determining if there is a statistically significant correlation between parking area and the quality of life in global cities. The main statistical analysis can be found on [Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/JuanesLamilla/CorrParkQOL_Public/blob/main/Analysis.ipynb).

#### Note:

Scraping code was modified to exclude API keys and other private information when necessary. Code shown here does not represent the entirety of the operations done on the data, as much was simply used to manually clean and format data. The full report details the extent of the data cleaning, but the final data used can all be found on *Cities_QOL.csv*
